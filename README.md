# Become a Shardler

Join our movement to Shardl Ethereum!

At Prysmatic Labs we believe in the ethos of Ethereum. We feel like it's only fitting that Ethereum's future (scaling the network) is built in a way the reflects its core properties of openness and decentralization. At Prysmatic, our team is composed of individuals from around the world who dedicate their free-time and energy to researching and innovating within the realm of **truly decentralized** blockchain scalability.

Scaling a **truly open, and truly decentralized** blockchain is no easy task; especially given the fact that... it's never been done before! But this is what makes it exciting, and this is why we're doing what we're doing.

But we need your help!

2. You can also help us out by donating to our team!

Prysmatic Labs is a not-for-profit effort built by a team of open-source contributors implementing sharding for Ethereum because we truly believe the protocol desperately needs. As a team, we may consider a for profit venture in the future, but we do not intend to profit directly from our work on sharding.
